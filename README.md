# overview.nvim

View and navigate a table of contents for markup files.

This [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) plugin, written in Lua, extracts a table of
contents from markup buffers and presents it in an unintrusive floating window.
The floating overview can also be used to navigate the open buffer.

Filetype support:
- [x] `markdown`
- [ ] `man`
- [ ] `tex`
- [ ] `help` (this is a `buftype`, not a `filetype`)
- [ ] `asciidoc`
- [ ] `changelog`
